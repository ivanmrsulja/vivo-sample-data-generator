# Set the minimum number of colleges for your sample university.  SDG will generate a university with somewhere between min and max number of colleges.  If min = max, that number will be used.

min_colleges_per_university = 1

# The maximum number of colleges for your sample university.  Be careful.  Large numbers will generate large amounts of data

max_colleges_per_university = 1

# the number of academic departments per college.  Some college will have less, some more, but all will be in the range [min, max]

min_departments_per_college = 1
max_departments_per_college = 1

# the number of faculty per academic department.  If there are 3 colleges, and each has 3 departments, and each department has 30 faculty members, your university will have 270 faculty.

# The relative frequency of the kinds of works in the collection you would like to generate.  SDG generates 25 different kinds of works -- academic articles, books, software, etc
# The first number is the relative frequency of academic articles.  The second number is for blog posts.  The number "300" indicates there should be 60 times as many academic articles in the 
# generated data as there are blog posts.  If all the numbers are the same, an equal distribution of works will be generated.  The 25 types are
# AcademicArticle, BlogPosting, Book, BookSection, CaseStudy, Chapter, ConferencePaper, ConferencePoster, Database, EditedBook, EditorialArticle, ExtensionDocument, Film, Letter, Newsletter,
# NewsRelease, Patent, Report, Review, Software, Speech, Thesis, Video, Webpage, Website
# If the relative frequency of a kind of work is 0, no works of that kind will be generated
# As an example, to generate data with many Films, change the 13th number in the list below from 5 to something larger such as 100.  Then Films would be generated 20 times as often as the
# kinds that have a 5 such as BlogPosting, and would be generated about 1/3 as often as AcademicArticles
